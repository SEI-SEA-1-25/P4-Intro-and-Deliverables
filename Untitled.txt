Portfolio Site - 

JavaScript (Node.js, Express.js, EJS), Spotify & GitHub APIs
May 2020 - Present

Server-rendered web app using Express and EJS, written in a modular format for easy maintenance in the future.

Used JAMstack principles to avoid heavy network calls, by storing all external data into a MongoDB Atlas database. The biggest benefit: avoiding
authenticated requests to external services such as Spotify and GitHub.
Ongoing development: refactoring the entire site to Next.js and Flow for Static Site Generation and static type checking.
Introduced LESS preprocessor to enable modularity and code efficiency, leveraging global variables to manage colors and fonts
