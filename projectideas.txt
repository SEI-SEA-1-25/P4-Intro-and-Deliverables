Come up with three project ideas and answer the following questions about each of them:

-------------------IDEA 1: 🗡🦄🧜‍♂️ Choose your own adventure! 🧜‍♂️🦄🗡--------------------------
1. How do you plan on learning/implementing this new technology?
    I want to use javascript to create a logic driven game. There will be mernAuth, 
    plenty of CSS styling, and many out comes. I would also like to animate each page of the
    game using CSS animation & Canvas.

2. What is your goal with this project?
    The goal of this project would be to cement my knowledge of Javascript Logic,
    better understand storing data with MongoDB and improve my skills at creating
    something beautiful and interactive.

3. Who is the user for your app?
    This app would mostly be for teens, or anyone who enjoys high-fantasy.

4. Any potential roadblocks you think you might run into?
    I plan on making the game fairly complex, so I would really get into setting state
    and more math-y JS.

-------------------IDEA 2: 📸 Photo Editor 📸 ------------------------------
1. How do you plan on learning/implementing this new technology?
    I plan on using DS.js, canvas, JS and CSS tp create a mostly front-end app.
    I would also need a form to input the user's photo. Maybe a small mongoDB library
    of example photos.

2. What is your goal with this project?
    The goal of this project would to be hone in on what different techs 
    I can use to create a user friendly website, where the user can fully 
    make their pictures look professional... or like a work of art.  

3. Who is the user for your app?
    This application would be more for adults, really anyone who needs a very
    easy way to spruce up their photos.

4. Any potential roadblocks you think you might run into?
    I am interested in a bunch of artistic examples on D3.js' website.
    They seem to be using combining powerful visualization components and a data-driven 
    approach to DOM manipulation. I would like to use many interesting methods.

-------------------IDEA 2: 👦🖍🔤 Fun Child's Educational/Game 🔤🖍👦------------------------------
1. How do you plan on learning/implementing this new technology?
    This app would have 4 different main pages. 

2. What is your goal with this project?
    Each page would do something rather different
    than the others. This would give me a lot of choices on showcasing learned, and 
    new techs. It would include a "paint shop"- like a artist studio, an animated game--
    something like my P1 but much more polished, a very simple quiz game-- something to do with 
    spelling or colors and a "choose your own adventure" game.
  

3. Who is the user for your app?
    For children ages 4-7 years old.

4. Any potential roadblocks you think you might run into?
    Just given the sheer amount I would need to accomplish with this.
