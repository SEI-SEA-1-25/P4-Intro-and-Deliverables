# Project 4 Ideas


## Option A:  WeChef using Ruby on Rails & React Stack

### Synopsis: 

WeChef is a 2 part web application that has social media application for 1 specific type of user: Real Chefs; and simply a search/read-only application for regular users.  The average user is someone intersted in high quality recipes that have been curated by real chefs.  The real chefs use WeChef to scour the internet for recipes, pick the ones they're interested in, rate them, comment on them or even edit them.  The users get to see which ones make the cut!

1. I've already dabbled into Ruby a bit and have even done some codewar challenges via ruby, so learning ruby may not be the challenge specifically.  In order to do this, Rails 5 can make a JSON API backend and React can make requests to the rails backend similarly how we did it with Mongoose.  There are several online resources showing how to do this, so essentially all of what Google has to offer me to make this happen is the answer to this question. 

2. My goal with this project is to really aquaint myself with ruby on rails as my newest job prospect utilizes this technology.  Additionally, I want more time with React in particular to really get better at using it.  

3. The user is someone who is simply looking for high quality recipes that are approved by chefs.  

4. Learning this new technology at the same time as getting a useable MVP going.  


## Option B:  'ServJob' with React & Rails Stack 

### Synopis:

Having working in the food service industry including being a business owner, finding a job and hiring help is a massively difficult process.  Normal applications that aren't tailored specifically to the food industry have a hard time at actually locating jobs for people who are looking for jobs and they don't to a great job at providing the desired information for businesses looking for help.  This application would provide the business owner as well as a person in the food industry a way to connect to one another.  

1. Since this is using the same stack as option A, this answer more or less is the same.  I plan on utilizing youtube, as well as other online resources to help me learn this new technology. 

2. Simply to utilize a Rails/React stack while also creating a solution to a problem I've encountered frequently. 

3. There are 2 types of users, Business Owners posting jobs and looking for help.  And service members who can search for job postings and submit their information to the businesses that create the post. 

4. Same as option A, simply just getting the Rails/React Framework up and running.  


## Option C: 'Chef2U' React/Rails Stack

### Synopsis: 

Have you ever wanted to treat your significant other to dinner but didn't want to go out, or cook it yourself?  Well thats where Chef2U comes in.  This is the "Uber" for hiring a private chef.  You can browse from a list of chef's with different culinary backgrounds and expertise to pick the right one for you. 

1. Since this is using the same stack as option A, and B this answer more also or less is the same.  I plan on utilizing youtube, as well as other online resources to help me learn this new technology.  

2. Simply put to learn ruby on rails, but also to see an application idea I've had for a long time come to life. 

3. The user is someone who is looking to hire a chef for an evening for just a couple, or for a gathering of friends/family and they want the food to be completely taken care of by a trained and professional chef. 

4. Same as option A & B, simply just getting the Rails/React Framework up and running.


## Option D: Meal Journal in MEAN or R/R stack

### Synopis:

Keeping track of what you're eating is key to a healthy lifestyle.  This application will make it easy to track what you eat by allowing you to make a record of it.  It also will give the nutrient values of the items you entered, so you can see a running total of the those values. 

1. Similarly to trying to pick up Rails and Ruby, I have found interest in Angular as a front end framework as well.  Since Angular is quite a popular framework there is a ton of resources online on how to implement it as well as learn how to use it.  I will take a short tutorial online on how to use it, if thats the route I go in. 

2. To learn a new language/framework simply, but also create a useful tool that I'd like to use everyday. 

3. The user is someone who would like an easy way to track what they're eating on a daily basis for a myraid of health/nutritional related reasons.  

4. I could see a roadblock being implementing Angular and learning how to use it in time before an MVP is acheived.  


## Option E:  Finance Tracker in MEAN or R/R stack

## Synopsis: 

Keeping track of finances can be challenging and confusing.  Spreadsheets can be tedious to use as well as difficult for the average user.  That is where Finance Tracker comes in, to help organize your monthly expenses to get a better idea of what your spending habits are to make smarter, more informed purchase decisions. 

1. Same as in option D, I plan on using the several online resources available to me as well as any instructors at GA who have experience with Angular and could also lend a hand at times when I'm stuck/debugging.  

2. To learn a new framework/language, but also to see if I can create something that is truly useful to the average person. 

3. The user is someone who has a hard time keeping track of their various bank accounts, credit card accounts and monthly subscriptions/expenses to truly see how much their spending vs. income is fluxuating or not.  This provides a solution for it. 

4. Not getting to MVP in time becuase I am troubleshooting/learning a new language while also creating an application.
