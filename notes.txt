P4 ideas 


Idea #1

Create a mern stack that implements d3.js to render charts of player data coming from the balldontlie.api
// alternatively
use the coinMarketCap api 
(https://coinmarketcap.com/api/documentation/v1/#section/Endpoint-Overview)

I am really interested in applying at a job at coinbase after I graduate and I think this would help my case. The nice to have's are to use ruby. 

I would like to speak to someone about how easy the implementation would be and then make my decision. 

How do you plan on learning/implementing this new technology?
Use the MERN stack plus d3.js
What is your goal with this project?
Create something cool
Who is the user for your app?
NBA geeks/statheads
//alternatively 
people interested in the crypto market
Any potential roadblocks you think you might run into?
I forsee having issues with the coinmarket api so I need to make sure read all the documentation.

Idea #2

Learn ruby to create a full stack web app using the IBM text to speech api.

(https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-userapikey#manage-user-keys)

How do you plan on learning/implementing this new technology?
Using either psql/mongo, ruby, and rails 
What is your goal with this project?
Learn as much as possible 
Who is the user for your app?
Anyone that needs a quick translation, is deaf, or is learning a new language 
Any potential roadblocks you think you might run into?

Figuring the implemention of the speech from the API. Im assumming i would need an additional technology to 
play the sounds. 


Idea #3
Book marketplace where you can list a book for sale

How do you plan on learning/implementing this new technology?

What is your goal with this project?

Who is the user for your app?
people that deeply care about books or just inherited a ton of books and needs to sell them. Very niche
Any potential roadblocks you think you might run into?
Creating a marketplace.
