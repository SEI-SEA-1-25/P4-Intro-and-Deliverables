A visualization of data with D3js:
    - using data from the Portland Housing API
    - using plant data to show plants that are good for certain climates

A random date night generator, returning restaurant, movie, activity info
based on user input and date

A way to use the plant API to create an in-home plant care app, using Swift.

Three ideas:
    1. Interactive data visualization in D3js, either using existing data, user-input,
        or API information.
    2. Night Out app - returning one randomly generated idea for a date/night out
        based on user-input(location, date, etc.) and APIs 
    3. Learning Swift to either utilize the Plant API to either create 
        a game, a care guide, or an informational app.


How do you plan on learning/implementing this new technology?
    1. Diving deep into the D3 docs and examples to learn visualization methods.
    2. Learning how to implement APIs according to user input to return random info
    3. Following the swift docs to learn this new programming language

What is your goal with this project?
    1. To learn an interesting new skill and broaden my knowledge
    2. To strengthen my understanding of full stack web apps
    3. To learn a new language that interests me, strengthen my comprehension

Who is the user for your app?
    1. Anyone that likes to see data presented in a unique and interactive way
    2. A person that wants to go out but is out of ideas, someone going on a date
    3. People that are interested in indoor plants

Any potential roadblocks you think you might run into?
    1. This seems crazy hard! So, a steep learning curve
    2. Utilizing multiple APIs seems really difficult and time-consuming
    3. Learning a new language and building a website in a week seems insane!
