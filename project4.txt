** Creating a game using React **

I decided to create a game using React for p4. ( 2048 puzzle / breaking blocks / frog crossing game)

How do you plan on learning/implementing this new technology? 
    - Watch tutorial videos on youtube or google
What is your goal with this project? 
    - Improving my react skill
Who is the user for your app? 
    - This app is for everyone
Any potential roadblocks you think you might run into? 
    - I haven't done creating a game using React so I need a lot of research how to use like canvas and etc.
